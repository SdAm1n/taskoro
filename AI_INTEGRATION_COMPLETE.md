## 🔧 Configuration Required

### **1. API Keys Setup**

Edit `/lib/config/ai_config.dart`:

```dart
static const String geminiApiKey = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY';
```

### **2. Get Gemini API Key**

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy and paste into the config file

### **3. Test on Real Device**

AI features work best on real Android devices with:

- Microphone access
- Internet connection
- Android 5.0+ (API level 21+)

## 📱 Permissions Added

The following Android permissions have been added to `AndroidManifest.xml`:

- ✅ `RECORD_AUDIO` - For speech recognition
- ✅ `MICROPHONE` - For voice input
- ✅ `INTERNET` - For AI API calls (already existed)

## 🎯 Key AI Capabilities

### **Natural Language Understanding**

- "Buy milk tomorrow" → Creates task with due date
- "High priority meeting at 3 PM" → Sets priority and time
- "Remind me to exercise" → Creates personal category task

### **Smart Task Parsing**

- Handles relative dates ("tomorrow", "next week")
- Understands priority levels ("urgent", "important")

### **Personalized Suggestions**

- Analyzes user's task history
- Suggests based on time of day and patterns
- Adapts to user categories and priorities

### **Voice Interactions**

## 🔄 AI Backends

The system automatically falls back through these backends:

1. **Gemini AI** (Primary) - When API key is configured
2. **Ollama Local** (Fallback) - For offline/local AI
3. **Rule-based** (Fallback) - Simple pattern matching

## 📊 Testing AI Features

### **Test Voice Input**

```bash
# Run on real device
flutter run
# Try voice task creation
# Test microphone permissions
```

### **Test AI Generation**

1. Create a new task
2. Enter title like "Plan birthday party"
3. Tap "Generate with AI"
4. Verify description is generated

### **Test AI Chat**

1. Open AI chat interface

- Ensure internet connection

### **AI Not Generating Content**

- Check API key configuration
- Verify internet connection
- Check logs for error messages

### **No Task Suggestions**
