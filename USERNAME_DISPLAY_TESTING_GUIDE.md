# Username Display Fix - Testing Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive testing plan to verify that the username display issue has been fixed.

## Issue Summary

**Before Fix**:

- New accounts would save username to Firestore but UI showed fallback username initially
- After logout/login, a new username was generated instead of showing the original

**After Fix**:

- Username should display immediately after registration
- Username should persist correctly across login/logout cycles
- No more unexpected fallback username generation

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Registration

**Objective**: Verify username displays immediately after account creation

**Steps**:

1. Open the Taskoro app
2. Navigate to "Create Account" screen
3. Fill in registration form:
   - Email: `test.user.$(timestamp)@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123`
   - Username: `testuser$(random)` (e.g., `testuser42`)
4. Tap "Create Account"
5. Wait for navigation to main screen

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Registration completes successfully
- ✅ App navigates to home screen
- ✅ Home screen greeting shows: "Hello, testuser42" (the exact username entered)
- ✅ Settings screen shows the same username in profile section
- ✅ No fallback username like "user123abc" is displayed

### Scenario 2: Login/Logout Persistence

**Objective**: Verify username persists after logout/login cycle

**Prerequisites**: Complete Scenario 1 first

**Steps**:

1. From the main screen, navigate to Settings
2. Scroll down and tap "Logout"
3. Confirm logout
4. On login screen, enter the same credentials used in registration
5. Tap "Sign In"
6. Navigate to home screen and settings

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Logout completes successfully
- ✅ Login completes successfully
- ✅ Home screen greeting shows the SAME username as before (e.g., "Hello, testuser42")
- ✅ Settings screen shows the SAME username
- ✅ NO new fallback username is generated

### Scenario 3: Username Update

**Objective**: Verify username can be updated and reflects immediately

**Prerequisites**: Complete Scenario 1 first

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to Settings → Edit Profile
2. Change username to a new value (e.g., `updateduser99`)
3. Tap "Save Changes"
4. Navigate back to home screen
5. Check settings screen again

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Username update completes successfully
- ✅ Home screen immediately shows new username: "Hello, updateduser99"
- ✅ Settings screen shows updated username
- ✅ Username persists after app restart

### Scenario 4: Google Sign-In

**Objective**: Verify Google Sign-In users get proper username

**Steps**:

1. On login screen, tap "Continue with Google"
2. Complete Google authentication
3. Check home screen and settings

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Google Sign-In completes successfully
- ✅ Home screen shows Google display name or email prefix
- ✅ No fallback username like "user123abc" is used

### Scenario 5: Network Conditions

**Objective**: Verify app handles poor network conditions gracefully

**Steps**:

1. Enable airplane mode or slow network
2. Attempt registration with slow/unreliable connection
3. Complete registration when connection is restored
4. Check username display

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Registration eventually completes
- ✅ Username displays correctly once connection is stable
- ✅ No duplicate or corrupted usernames

## Automated Testing

### Unit Tests

Run existing unit tests to ensure no regressions:

```bash
cd /home/s010p/Taskoro/taskoro
flutter test test/task_model_test.dart
flutter test test/task_provider_test.dart
```

**Expected**: All tests pass

### Integration Testing

If integration tests exist, run them:

```bash
flutter test integration_test/
```

## Debug Verification

### Console Logs

During testing, check console for proper debug output:

**Expected Logs**:

```
I/flutter: AuthWrapper - User authenticated, showing MainScreen
I/flutter: TaskProvider - Setting up user profile listener
I/flutter: TaskProvider - User profile loaded: [username]
```

**Warning Signs** (should NOT appear):

```
I/flutter: TaskProvider - No user profile found, using fallback
I/flutter: TaskProvider - Creating fallback username
```

### Firebase Console Verification

1. Open Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Check `users` collection
4. Verify new user documents have correct `displayName` field

**Expected Structure**:

```json
{
  "id": "user_uid_here",
  "email": "test.user@example.com",
  "displayName": "testuser42",  // Should match entered username
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "photoUrl": null
}
```

## Edge Case Testing

### Multiple Account Types

Test with different account creation methods:

- ✅ Email/Password registration
- ✅ Google Sign-In
- ✅ Existing accounts (backward compatibility)

### Rapid Operations

Test rapid user operations:

- ✅ Quick registration → immediate navigation
- ✅ Fast logout → login cycles
- ✅ Rapid username updates

### Data Consistency

Verify data remains consistent:

- ✅ Firebase Auth `displayName` matches Firestore `displayName`
- ✅ UI displays match stored data
- ✅ No data corruption during updates

## Success Criteria

The fix is considered successful if:

1. **✅ Immediate Display**: New users see their chosen username immediately after registration
2. **✅ Persistence**: Username persists correctly across login/logout cycles  
3. **✅ No Fallbacks**: No unexpected fallback usernames are generated
4. **✅ Updates Work**: Username updates reflect immediately in UI
5. **✅ Backward Compatible**: Existing users continue to work normally
6. **✅ All Account Types**: Works for email/password and Google Sign-In users
7. **✅ Edge Cases**: Handles network issues and rapid operations gracefully

## Troubleshooting

### If Username Still Not Displaying

1. Check Firebase Console for user document
2. Verify internet connection during registration
3. Check console logs for error messages
4. Try logout/login cycle
5. Clear app data and re-register

### If Fallback Username Appears

1. Check if Firestore user document exists
2. Verify Firebase Auth user has `displayName` set
3. Check timing of user profile stream initialization
4. Look for error logs in console

### If Username Doesn't Update

1. Verify Edit Profile functionality
2. Check Firebase Console for updated document
3. Try app restart
4. Check for permission issues

## Reporting Issues

If any test fails, report with:

- ✅ Exact steps to reproduce
- ✅ Expected vs actual behavior
- ✅ Console logs
- ✅ Firebase Console screenshots
- ✅ Device/platform information
