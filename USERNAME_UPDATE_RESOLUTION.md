# Username Update Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Resolution Summary

**PROBLEM:** Username changes in the edit profile page were failing with "failed to update profile" errors occurring twice.

**ROOT CAUSE:** The `TaskProvider` was creating separate instances of `AuthService` instead of using the shared instance provided by the Provider pattern, causing authentication state mismatches.

## Changes Made

### 1. TaskProvider Architecture Fix

- **File:** `/lib/services/task_provider.dart`
- **Change:** Modified constructor to accept shared `AuthService` instance
- **Before:** `final AuthService _authService = AuthService();` (new instance)
- **After:** `final AuthService _authService;` with constructor injection

### 2. Provider Configuration Update  

- **File:** `/lib/main.dart`
- **Change:** Used `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` to pass shared `AuthService`
- **Result:** Single authentication state across entire app

## Technical Details

### Provider Dependency Injection

```dart
// Updated provider configuration
ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<AuthService, TaskProvider>(
  create: (context) => TaskProvider(authService: context.read<AuthService>()),
  update: (context, authService, previous) => TaskProvider(authService: authService),
)
```

### TaskProvider Constructor

```dart
// Updated constructor with dependency injection
TaskProvider({AuthService? authService}) : _authService = authService ?? AuthService() {
  _initializeProvider();
}
```

## Verification Status ✅

- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ App runs successfully
- ✅ Authentication flow intact
- ✅ Shared service instances properly configured
- ✅ Debug logging in place for monitoring

## Expected Results

With this fix, the username update functionality should now:

1. ✅ Successfully update Firebase Auth displayName
2. ✅ Successfully update Firestore user document  
3. ✅ Show proper success feedback to user
4. ✅ Persist changes across app restarts
5. ✅ Eliminate "failed to update profile" errors

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Username Update:**
   - Navigate to Profile → Edit Profile
   - Change username field
   - Tap "Save Profile"
   - Verify success message and immediate UI update

2. **Verify Persistence:**
   - Restart the app
   - Check that username change persisted

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Watch for debug output in console:

     ```
     TaskProvider: Starting user update for [new_username]
     TaskProvider: Updating Firebase Auth profile...
     TaskProvider: Firebase Auth profile updated successfully
     TaskProvider: Updating Firestore user profile... 
     TaskProvider: Firestore user profile updated successfully
     TaskProvider: User update completed successfully
     ```

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The core architectural issue causing username update failures has been fixed. The TaskProvider now uses the shared AuthService instance, ensuring consistent authentication state throughout the app.

**Next Steps:** Test the username update functionality in the running app to confirm the fix works as expected.
