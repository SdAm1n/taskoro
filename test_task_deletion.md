# Task Deletion Fix Test Plan

## What Was Fixed

The issue was a race condition where:

1. UI calls `TaskProvider.deleteTask(taskId)`
2. TaskProvider calls Firebase to delete the task
3. TaskProvider returns `true` immediately
4. UI calls `_updateFilteredTasksWithProvider()`
5. But the Firestore stream hasn't updated `_tasks` yet
6. So deleted task still appears in UI

## Fix Implemented

Modified `TaskProvider.deleteTask()` to:

1. Delete from Firebase as before
2. **Wait for the stream listener to update `_tasks`** by polling
3. Only return after the task is removed from local `_tasks` list
4. Include timeout (5 seconds) as safety net
5. Added logging for debugging

## Test Steps

1. **Open the app and navigate to task list**
2. **Create a test task** (or use existing task)
3. **Delete the task** using swipe or delete button
4. **Verify the task disappears immediately** from the UI
5. **Check console logs** to see the deletion flow:
   - "Deleting task X from Firebase..."
   - "Waiting for stream to update after deletion of task X..."
   - "Task X successfully deleted and removed from UI"
6. **Test from different screens:**
   - Home screen task list (swipe to delete)
   - Task detail screen (delete button)
   - Calendar view (if applicable)

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Task should disappear from UI immediately after deletion
- ✅ No "ghost" tasks remaining in the list
- ✅ Deletion should work from all screens
- ✅ Console should show proper logging sequence
- ✅ Error handling should still work if deletion fails

## Edge Cases to Test

1. **Delete task that doesn't exist** - should return `true` without error
2. **Network issues during deletion** - should show error message
3. **Multiple rapid deletions** - should handle concurrent operations
4. **Timeout scenario** - if stream takes >5 seconds, should fallback to local removal

## Files Modified

- `/lib/services/task_provider.dart` - Enhanced `deleteTask()` method with stream synchronization
