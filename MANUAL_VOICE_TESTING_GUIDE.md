# Manual Voice Feature Testing Guide

## üéØ **TESTING OBJECTIVE**

Validate that the voice feature in Taskoro app now works correctly after implementing comprehensive fixes for speech recognition issues.

## üì± **PRE-TESTING SETUP**

### **Step 1: Install Updated App**

The app has been installed on your Android device (RMX2103). If you need to reinstall:

```bash
cd /home/s010p/Taskoro/taskoro
flutter run -d f50278c0
```

**‚ùå Failure Indicators:**

- "Couldn't hear anything" appears immediately
- Dialog closes without capturing speech
- Shows permission errors

### **Test 2: Debug Menu Testing**

**Steps:**

1. In AI chat, tap the **‚ãÆ** (three dots) menu
2. Select **"Debug Speech"**
3. This opens a comprehensive debug panel
4. Tap **"Test Basic Speech"**
5. Speak when prompted

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**

- Debug menu appears
- Shows detailed speech status information
- Displays permission status as "granted"
- Shows available speech locales
- Captures test speech successfully

### **Test 3: Permission Handling**

**Steps:**

1. Go to device **Settings** ‚Üí **Apps** ‚Üí **Taskoro** ‚Üí **Permissions**
2. **Disable** microphone permission
3. Return to Taskoro and try voice input
4. **Expected**: Should show clear permission error message
5. Should guide you to enable permissions
6. Re-enable microphone permission and test again

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**

- Shows clear permission denied message
- Provides guidance to fix permissions
- Works correctly after re-enabling permissions

## üìä **MONITORING AND LOGGING**

### **Log Monitoring Script**

If you want to monitor logs while testing:

```bash
cd /home/s010p/Taskoro/taskoro
./test_speech_fixes.sh
```

This will show real-time speech recognition logs.

### **Key Log Messages to Look For**

**‚úÖ Good Signs:**

```
I/flutter: Speech Status: listening
I/flutter: Speech result: "your spoken text" (confidence: 0.95)
I/flutter: Sound level: 5.2
I/flutter: Speech recognition completed successfully
```

**‚ùå Problem Signs:**

```
I/flutter: Speech recognition stopped. Final result: ""
I/flutter: Microphone permission not granted
I/flutter: Speech service not available
```

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue: "Couldn't hear anything instantly"**

**Possible Causes:**

- Microphone permission not granted
- Hardware microphone issue
- Background noise interference

**Solutions:**

1. Check microphone permissions in device settings
2. Test in a quiet environment
3. Ensure no other apps are using microphone
4. Restart the app

### **Issue: Speech starts but stops immediately**

**Fixed in this update!** Previously this was caused by:

- Poor speech recognition configuration
- Missing `partialResults: true` parameter
- Incorrect timeout settings

**New Configuration Applied:**

- `partialResults: true` for real-time feedback
- `cancelOnError: false` to prevent premature stopping
- `listenMode: ListenMode.confirmation` for better detection
- Reduced `pauseFor` timeout from 3s to 2s

### **Issue: BuildContext errors in logs**

**Fixed in this update!** All BuildContext across async gaps have been resolved.
